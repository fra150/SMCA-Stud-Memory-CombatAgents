## 🧠 What is BAS?

Current LLMs fail at long context. **BAS changes the paradigm.**

Instead of asking one model to read 500 pages (and inevitably forget), BAS creates **500 specialized agents**, each expert on one page, connected by StudSar as a unified brain. It is a **dynamic cognitive architecture** that combines:

- **Dynamic agent scaling** — N agents = N document segments (not fixed)
- **Semantic selection** — agents chosen by cosine similarity, not position
- **Post-retrieval reasoning** — dedicated executor for numerical aggregation
- **Context-aware filtering** — pre-calculation filtering by transaction type
- **Perfect needle retrieval** — 100% accuracy on facts hidden in 50-segment documents
- **Flawless Multi-Hop Reasoning** — 100% accuracy on correlating independent segments

At its core lives **StudSar Centrale** — the central memory system that transforms static document segments into living associative knowledge, enriched with emotional tags and temporal metadata.

## 🏛️ Architecture — The Five Pillars

### `01` — BAS Engine · *The Neural Cortex*

Dynamic agent creation where document complexity dictates agent count. Runs entirely on standard CPU using `sentence-transformers` for embedding generation. Each agent holds exactly one segment, creating true expertise rather than generalized forgetting.

### `02` — Semantic Selection · *The Thalamus*

No positional bias. The system calculates cosine similarity between query embedding and segment embeddings, selecting only the most relevant agents for combat. **Impact:** Needle accuracy improved from 50% → 100%.

### `03` — Post-Retrieval Executor · *The Prefrontal Cortex*

A dedicated numerical reasoning layer that separates retrieval from computation. Features multi-language keyword mapping (Italian "entrate" → English "income"), strict type filtering, and automatic net balance computation (income - expense).

### `04` — StudSar Centrale · *The Hippocampus*

The shared memory system connecting all agents as a unified brain. Agents don't just retrieve text — they access living markers with emotional resonance, usage frequency, and temporal decay. Memory coherence monitoring via TMDR (Temporal Memory Decay Regression).

### `05` — Giudice BAS · *The Executive Control*

Emergent standards evaluation with confidence scoring. The Judge determines when aggregation requires the Post-Retrieval Executor versus direct answer generation. When uncertainty exceeds thresholds, **Dio** (the User) intervenes.
